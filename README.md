  <h1> Carol Dweck</h1>  

       <p1> Carol Dweck's theory on intelligence or education is confidence is key to higher intelligence. 

         Confidence means learning from mistakes and not being discouraged from problems, which cause educational 

         barriers. Dweck advicates for a non-discouragement method, where instead of teachers failing teachers for not doing well, 

         teachers instead they give reinforcement by telling the students "next time" they will get it. </p1>

  <h2> Dereck Muller</h2>

  <p2> Derek Muller, however, believes in the theory of exploitation. Muller will exploit people for the purpose

          of education. By showing people that their misconceptions are wronge and telling them the truth, people will

          be more willing to learn from their mistakes and learn from them. Mny people are unaware of phenomenons

          which affect their everyday lives, for example, the growth of trees through carbon dioxide; Muller is able

          to interview these people and show them the truth of nature or phenomenons which people never think about. Therefore,

          the people being surveyed are able to grow and strengthen their intelligence.

   <h3> Similarities:</h3>

  <p3> Similarly, both Dweck and Muller believe that the only true answer for higher intelligence is learning from 

          ones mistakes. Dweck demonstrates fixed mindset people have trouble learning from their mistakes because people

          do not enjoy being wrong. Futhermore, Dwecks demonstation of people with Growth Mindset shows that people only achieve

          growth by learning from their mistakes and persevering. Muller also demonstrates the theory of people learn from their

          mistakes, however, Muller uses a different method. </p3>

     <p4> A personal theory on intellectual growth is learning by one's self is key to growth. There is a level of maturity 

       when learning from yourself and not having someone guide you along the way. Independence shows growth because someone is 

       able to self teach and learn from personal experiences. </p4>
